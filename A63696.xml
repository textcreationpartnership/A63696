            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56639:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 105 -->matter of fact, and leave the comment to your ſelf.</p>
            <p>When theſe Rebels had taken <hi>Glaſcough,</hi> they publickly made Proclamation. That they fought againſt Supremacy, Prelacy and Popery. At the end of which Proclamation, one called <hi>Belfour</hi> of <hi>Kinloch</hi> held up his hand and cried with a loud voice, <hi>This is the hand that killed Sharp,</hi> (to wit, the Lord Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> and no wonder the Miſcreant rob'd him of his Title, having before bereaved him of his Life) This done, away they went to my Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Glaſcough</hi>'s Houſe, and having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly entred it, tore down all his Hangings, and then tore them all to pieces. They broke open all his Trunks, tore his Clothes, drained his Cellars; and in a word, made a miſerable havock of all they found. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eſcaped them ſave ſome few of the beſt of his Books, which were before they could get to his Houſe ſecured by ſome of the honeſt Neighbours. And it may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be preſumed this Reverend Prelate had fell a Sacrifice to their Deviliſh fury, had he been in their way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56639:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 105 -->
But as if all this were not enough to make them eternally odious and loathſome to all good and ſober men; they added another piece of Villany which is ſcarce to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld in any ſtory; which is this: They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, and rifled the Biſhop of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Houſe, deſtroying all they could find there; and that done, went to the Grave where ſome time ſince two of the foreſaid Biſhop's Children were buried; took up the Coffins, broke them open, and run their Swords through them ſeveral times, and left the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the poor Infants above ground, as Monuments of their Inhuman Villany and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>And as if they could not be ſatisfied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the ſin of Rebellion, Murder, and Rapine, they likewiſe added that of Sacriledg; they went to the High Cathedral Church, and rifled that, took away the Linnen uſed at the Adminiſtration of the Bleſſed Sacrament; and had ſeized the Communion-Plate too, had it not before their coming been conveyed away.</p>
            <p>Thus far went theſe Rebels, and loth to ſtop
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56639:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 106 -->here, Crowned all their Villanies with one more, <hi>viz.</hi> They pulled down his Majeſty's Picture, which was in the great Hall of the Merchants Hoſpital, and then tore it to pieces, uttering thoſe treaſonable and horrid ſpeeches againſt His Sacred Majeſty that are not fit to be heard by any Chriſtian man. One of them Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Ruglin-Green,</hi> a Village near <hi>Glaſcough,</hi> had this paſſage, viz. <hi>That the King had ſet up his Banner;</hi> but told them, <hi>they had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt to ſet up his Banner, and they might eaſily judg which would prevail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates of the foreſaid Town, the Maſters of the Colledg, and Miniſter of the place, all fled, ſome to <hi>Dunbertin</hi> Caſtle, ſome to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and ſome to other places.</p>

HAving given you this brief Account of their Barbarities, I ſhall now give you in a few words the ſtate of Affairs here in relation to them.</p>
            <p>There were ſome of them got together in <hi>Fife,</hi> who begun to Plunder, and ſteal Horſes and Arms, with a reſolution to reinforce the Rebels. But upon my Lord Chancellors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to <hi>Fife</hi> to ſuppreſs theſe diſorders, and to haſten out the Militia and Heretors of that Shire, they vaniſhed and fled towards <hi>Sterling;</hi> where my Lord <hi>Elfingſtoun,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Deputy-Steward for the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Down,</hi> happily met with them near the Paſs, killed and took almoſt the whole party, and brought in about a hundred Horſemen Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Sterling;</hi> where they are now ſecured. Among theſe Priſoners they ſay there are three (if not four) of my Lord St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
            <p>The Militia and the Heritors from the three <hi>Lowdens, Tivedale,</hi> and the <hi>Merff,</hi> with thoſe from <hi>Fife,</hi> are already come hither, who with the ſtanding forces make a conſiderable body,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56639:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 108 -->with which they intend to march towards the Enemy to morrow or next day; and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Shire of <hi>Perth</hi> and <hi>Sterling,</hi> are to join them in their March. The Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery is ready, and all other Neceſſaries provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them. And every thing elſe is done that may tend to the ſuppreſſing this Rebellion. All of them both Horſe and Foot are brisk and reſolute, being animated by a good Cauſe; and for a Gracious Prince, their Laws, Lives, and Liberties.</p>
